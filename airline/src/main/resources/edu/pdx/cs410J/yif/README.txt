Project 3: Pretty Printing Your Airline
For this project, the PrettyPrinter has implemented. Also, the Flight and Airline Classes have been modified to support the sorting function. They also use the Date as their fields.
Parsing the command line has been implemented in class Project3.
The format for the parsable data has been modified.
The modified version is shown as below:
airline 		The name of the airline
flightNumber 		The flight number
src 		Three-letter code of departure airport
departDate 		MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm aa
dest 		Three-letter code of arrival airport
arriveDate 	MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm aa

Through the options specified by the command line arguments "-print" and "-README", program can print a description of the Flight or print the content of README.
The option "-textFile file" can make user load from and write back to a file specified in the command line.
The new option "-pretty file" can pretty print the airline and flights to the file specified.
If "-" presents for the "file" field, then the information will be printed to the screen.
